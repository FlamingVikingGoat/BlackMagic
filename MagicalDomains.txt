--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control: The seed of all magic, Control only contains one (self-named) domain; control is represented by a spider's
web. While this group is not stronger or weaker against any other types of magic, control magic takes precedent
over other types.

	The Control Domain is focused on effects that make or change rules; this magic restricts, imprisons,
	and manipulates. Control Mages are refered to as Nobles (a reference to their magic's rule-setting abilities),
	and it's main item is a piece of string.
		Restricting: Control Magic can be used to create areas that have different rules than outside
		that area. Control magic can enchant tracks of land that limit magic usage, change costs and
		effectiveness of spells, and high level Nobles are even able to change the life-forces of entities
		in enchanted areas.
		
		Imprisoning: Control Magic is perhaps most infamous batle-wise for its ability to remove abilities
		from others as if the target were imprisoned(note that Imprisoning is different from Restricting
		based on target- Restricting targets and area, while Imprisoning targets entities). This includes
		stopping movement and limiting actions- including spellcasting. A powerful Noble can even stop an
		entity from breathing, slowly killing the victim.

		Maniplation: Control Magic in its most powerful form is the ability to manipulate both the concrete
		and the abstract. At early stages, Nobles practicing manipulation can only move objects around; At 
		higher stages, Nobles manipulate the fabric of reality itself. They can change the growth stage of 
		an object, and even change the rate of time!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destruction: Magic focusing on tearing objects away from the fabric of reality, Destruction contains three domains:
Pain, Obliteration, and Deconstruction. Pain accomplishes Destruction's goal by brutishly choping away at objects:
it burns trees, scratches flesh, and wears down sanity. Obliteration, perhaps the most literal form of Destruction,
replaces existence with void; it removes wholly an object from the fabric of reality. Deconstruction is perhaps best
described as Pain's controlled cousin; it carefully divides an object by its aspects and separates them. Sometimes
this takes the form of partitioning and separating an object, sometimes it simply removes one or two aspects from an
object.
